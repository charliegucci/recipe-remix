## Current Position

- **Milestone:** v1.0
- **Phase:** 1 of 6 (Foundation) - COMPLETE
- **Plan:** 4 of 4 complete
- **Status:** Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2
- **Last activity:** 2026-02-05 - Completed 01-04-PLAN.md (Auth UI and Responsive Layout)

**Progress:** [####............] 4/4 Phase 1 plans (Phase complete)

## Progress

| Phase | Name | Plans | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation | 4/4 | Complete |
| 2 | Core Read Path | 0/? | Ready |
| 3 | Pantry and User Features | 0/? | Pending |
| 4 | AI Generation Pipeline | 0/? | Pending |
| 5 | Fusion Intelligence and Polish | 0/? | Pending |
| 6 | Observability and Hardening | 0/? | Pending |

## Phase 1 Deliverables

Foundation complete with:
- Nuxt 4 + NuxtHub + Cloudflare D1/R2/KV
- Tailwind CSS v4 with mobile-first responsive design
- Drizzle ORM with auth schema (users, sessions, accounts, verifications)
- Better Auth with email/password + anonymous user support
- Responsive app shell (header, layout, footer)
- Auth UI (login, register, guest flow)

All success criteria verified:
- USER-01: Sign up with email/password
- USER-02: Login persists across browser close (7-day session)
- USER-03: Guest access without blocking
- INFR-01: Responsive layout, no horizontal scroll at 320px

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Phase |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Nuxt 4 via compatibility layer | Nuxt 4 stable not yet released; use future.compatibilityVersion: 4 | 01-01 |
| Tailwind v4 with Vite plugin | Better Vite integration than PostCSS approach | 01-01 |
| Assets in app/ directory | Nuxt 4 structure places assets under app/ | 01-01 |
| Integer mode:timestamp for dates | SQLite has no native datetime; Drizzle handles conversion | 01-02 |
| Include verifications table | Prepares for future email verification | 01-02 |
| Request-scoped DB access pattern | Use useDrizzle(event) within handlers, never at module scope | 01-02 |
| Lazy auth initialization via getAuth() | D1 bindings only available within request handlers, not at module scope | 01-03 |
| Auth server in server/lib/, client in app/lib/ | Nuxt 4 separates client (app/) from server (server/) directories | 01-03 |
| Migrations in server/database/migrations | NuxtHub default path for automatic migration detection | 01-03 |
| window.location.href for post-auth redirects | navigateTo() doesn't trigger full reload, causing stale session cookie state | 01-04 |
| NUXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL env var for baseURL | Clean production configuration without hardcoded URLs | 01-04 |

## Patterns Established

| Pattern | Description | Phase |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Request-scoped D1 | hubDatabase() only callable within request handlers | 01-02 |
| Lazy initialization | Use getAuth() getter instead of module-scope auth instance | 01-03 |
| Nuxt 4 directory structure | Client code in app/, server code in server/ | 01-03 |
| Post-auth redirect | Use window.location.href not navigateTo() for session cookies | 01-04 |
| Mobile-first responsive | Unprefixed Tailwind classes for mobile, sm:/md:/lg: for larger screens | 01-04 |

## Concerns

(None)
